# Energy-consumption-metering-and-forecasting
Development of a machine learning based model to predict energy consumption in an university campus environment in real time.

# Data Acquisition 
The datasets that was used for the development of the machine learning model are available in https://github.com/FatimaAABADI/Energy-consumption-metering-and-forecasting/tree/main/Data

#Data description
The data of 4 smart meters corresponding to 4 different profils is used in this study. The energy consumption of every 15 minutes, for 11 months (27-07-2017/04-07-2018) has been used.
